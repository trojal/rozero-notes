# Smelting (제련)

## What is the smelting system?

This is a system that improves the abilities of weapons and armor. If you are successful when smelting, 'SUCCESS' displays, and the item's smelting rate will increase by +1.

If smelting fails, items and costs used in smelting, as well as cards in the socket, will be destroyed.

## Smelting explained

Smelting can be done via the Blacksmith NPC in each town. The Blacksmith is displayed as a hammer image on the mini-map.
