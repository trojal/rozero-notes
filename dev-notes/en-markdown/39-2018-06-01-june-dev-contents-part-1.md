Hi. Ragnarok Zero Users, It is Ragnarok Zero team of RO1 studio. Today, we will introduce some of the contents that will be updated in June.

## 1. New recovery item

New recovery item "Syrup" (“시럽”) will be added. The price is higher than potions sold by the Tool Dealer, there is a usage level restriction and a cooldown, but the recovery amount is high. These new recovery items can be purchased through the new NPC in the Tool Shop.
