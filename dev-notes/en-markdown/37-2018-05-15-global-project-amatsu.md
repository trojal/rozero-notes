# [Global Project] Amatsu

[ 2018.05.15 ]

Hi Ragnarok users. Ragnarok Zero team of RO1 studio here. Today, we will introduce the second localized area, Amatsu, which will be added on May 23rd.

## Global Project 2nd Area –  Amatsu

The second localized area Amatsu, based on the region of Japan, will be added.

An overview of Amatsu is shown below.

"Through a stranger lost to the past, a route connecting Alberta and the villages of Amatsu was opened. After five years of preparation, the King of Rune Midgard and the Lords of Amatsu proclaimed the beginning of full-scale trading, and many adventurers and merchants traveled to Amatsu in anticipation of unfamiliar landscapes and new adventures."

You can take a boat to Amatsu by paying 10,000 zeny to the "Amatsu Publicity Resident" located in Alberta (alberta 246 34). Please note that you can move to Amatsu from base level 70 or higher.
