# June Development Contents Guide - Part 3 (Content Added)

[ 2018.06.19 ]

Hi Ragnarok Zero Users, it is the Ragnarok Zero team of RO1 studio. Today, we will introduce you to the last part of the development contents guide for June.

## 1. Armor update
 
The new Fever armor series, "Lava" (“용암”), will be updated in response to the Schwartzwald Republic update. This time, you will be given a random option in each piece, including armor and shoes, and you will be given bonus options if you wear all the parts that fit the set and you meet the degree of smelting. In addition, "Lava" equipment can be worn by all occupations.

Some existing class essence enchantments have been altered. See table below.

## 4. Enchantment NPC for secondary and extended jobs

As the new classes enchantments are added, the enchants given by the existing enchant NPCs is changed. Now, the existing Enchant NPC no longer gives the enchants for the secondary and extended occupation groups, but a new NPC "Intermediate Enchantment Association Staff" (“중급 인챈트 협회 직원”) does.

Intermediate Enchantment Association Staff is an NPC that only gives job essence enchants to +9 Expedition, Dispatching, and Conquering Memorial Dungeon equipment.

Enchantment costs for intermediate enchantment can either be high Zeny or a fixed number of Gel Star. If you enchant with Zeny, there's a higher probability of getting a level 2 essence than if you enchant with Gel Star.

However, there is a difference in cost depending on the armor level, and depending on the rank, the stats-based enchants must be completed in all slots before you can attempt a class-based essence enchant.

< You can choose between enchanting with Zeny or Gel Star, and Zeny is more likely to be awarded with Lvl 2 essence enchant! >

< You can save Zeny by using Gel Star, but there is a high probability of getting a Lvl 1 enchant >

## 5. Localization-specific weapon random option granted

It will now cost 150,000 Zeny to add a random option to a localization-specific (Louyang, Amatsu, etc.) weapon instead of requiring item collection.

< Now you can easily purchase orders with Zeny instead of special items! >

## 6. New equipment drops update

You will be able to acquire new equipment from various monsters in the area added by the Schwartwald Republic update. For example, various Ninja weapons are added. New equipment options will be introduced on the official website at a later date.

< Equipment available in the newly added areas are available! >

## 7. Add Mithril acquisition method

In the 3rd floor Nogg Road Fever area, a new Mithril acquisition method will be added. Monsters will drop "Lava Stone Extractor" (“용암 원석 추출기”) and "Question Ore" (“의문의 광석”), which can contain Mithril Ore.

Of course, Mithril Ore will also drop regularly there as well.

< "Lava Stone Extractor" and "Mysterious Ore" can be obtained from Nogg Road 3F monsters. >

## 8. Clock Tower Dungeon Update

The Clock Tower miniboss mob spawn has changed. Before it was a random area spawn after a specific mob kill count, but now it's the same as a champion mob.

Also, a new mechanic is added where if you die you just get a gray screen where you can't see other players, monsters, chat, announcements -- anything really.

That's it for the three parts of the June update. These will go into effect on June 27th. Some content may be changed before then, so please refer to the announcement on the official homepage.

Thank you.
