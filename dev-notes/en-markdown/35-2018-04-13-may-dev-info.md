## 2. Guild Dungeon Open (Completed)

Soon the guild dungeon opens. Guild dungeon is a dungeon with special rules. Basically, PVP is possible and everyone is an enemy (including party members) if they're not in your guild.

The guild dungeon is divided into two layers. One layer can only be accessed by those who own a castle on the map associated with the dungeon. The other layer can be accessed by anyone by paying a certain amount of Zeny.

Each guild dungeon consists of monsters in the level of 115 - 120. Valkyrie realm consists of insect-type monsters, and Britoniah consists of undead monsters.

Each monster will drop a "Guild Hideout Coin" (“길드 아지트 주화”), which can be exchanged for special PVP equipment or consumption items. For more information, please refer to the announcement on the official homepage.

## 3. Job balance

The skill balance adjustment is scheduled to be updated for all secondary career targets in May. As we mentioned in the last developer note, some of the job classes were scheduled for adjustment in April. However, we are expanding the target occupations to all professions so that various jobs can be improved and various kinds of jobs can be developed.

Today I will briefly introduce the improvements that are scheduled for each job.

### 1) Knight

#### Bowling Bash

To resolve the ambiguity of the target to be hit, the skill is changed to a new criteria. By default it hits the targets and targets within a 5 x 5 cell radius 2 times. In addition, if the weapon used is a Two-Handed Sword, it hits 3 times if the target number is 2 - 3. If there are 4 or more monsters in the 5 x 5 cell area, it hits 4 times and it can damage up to 2000% depending. Skill cooldown is added.

## 6. About Bard & Dancer (Complete)

We will let you know about further updates and improvements to the added Bard & Dancer jobs this week. (The job group balance adjustment update schedule shown above is for May, and the following is scheduled to be updated on April 25th.)

** TODO: Finish the below translation. Lots of stuff here that Google Translate struggles with.

바드&댄서 직업군의 모든 합주/연주/춤 스킬은 기존 라그나로크 온라인에서부터 캐스팅이 없이 발동하는 대신 유지되는 시간동안 이동 속도가 느려지고 악기를 제외한 다른 무기로 변경하여 스킬을 취소해야 하는 불편함이 존재했습니다. 그렇기 때문에 기존에 비해 기동성 및 편의성이 도입된 대신 최소한의 패널티로 캐스팅이 추가로 적용된 것입니다.

그러나 합주/연주/춤의 특수성(마법적인 효과를 가진 것이 아닌 연주와 춤이라는 동작에서 발생하는 효능)을 고려하여 캐스팅은 존재하지만 기본적으로 끊기지 않는 속성을 추가하여 플레이의 편의성을 제공하고자 합니다. (단, 스펠 브레이커와 같은 기능에는 끊길 수 있습니다.)

추가로 각 스킬 별 캐스팅 시간도 대폭 감소될 예정이며, 합주/연주/춤 스킬 효과가 특정 조건에서 해제되는 것을 해제되지 않도록 개선할 예정입니다.

이외에도 합주 후유증의 지속시간이 대폭 감소될 예정이며, 브라기의 시와 수프라기움의 효과의 연산이 합연산이 되어 적용될 수 있도록 개선할 예정입니다. (단, 브라기의 시와 수프라기움의 변동 캐스팅 옵션의 경우 스킬에 의한 변동 캐스팅 감소가 적용된 후, 장비에 부여된 변동 캐스팅 감소 옵션이 적용되기 때문에 아이템 옵션의 변동 캐스팅 값과 합산되어 적용되지는 않습니다.)

김서방 돈 벌었네의 경우 퀘스트 경험치까지 증가되는 현상이 확인되었으며, 이에 대해 몬스터 처치시 획득하는 경험치를 증가시켜주는 효과로 변경될 예정입니다.

So far we have introducted what the team is developing. We're still in the process of development, so some changes may occur. For more details, we will send you an update through our official website.

Thank you.
