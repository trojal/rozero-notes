# December Content Updates (more)

[ 2018.11.30 ]

Hi. Ragnarok Zero users. It is Ragnarok Zero team of RO1 studio. The 1st anniversary of Ragnarok ZERO is approaching. Our Ragnarok ZERO development team is preparing to update in December so that you can have a rich year end with the upcoming anniversary event. Today, we will show you about the contents to be updated in December 2018.

## 1. Steel City Einbroch Update

The steel city of Einbroch, responsible for the industrialization of the Republic of Schwarzwald, will be added. Einbroch is an industrial city developed with minerals from the mining town Einbech. With Einbroach, you can get new equipment and experience upgraded random options with the Einbech Mine Dungeon.

< Steel City Einbroach is added!! >

Also, Einbech Dungeon 3rd Floor is a region of high difficulty, so it warrants special attention.

## 2. Transcendent System Update

Now characters who are second class and level 99 can transcend.

After passing the Transcendent Quest, your character will become a High Novice. Also, you will be able to change your class at this time, so if you want to become something else, you can (i.e. a Priest can become a Lord Knight).

Also, transcendent classes have a base level of 120, a job level of 70, more status points, and new skills.

< After transcending, you will gain more power! >

After transcending, you will become a High Novice and you can go on to become a High First Class and High Second Class. You can freely change your job regardless of your previous job. To change classes, you have to pay a certain amount of Zeny. (For example, if you are a Priest, you can transcend and become a High Priest for free, but if you pay a certain amount of money, you can become a Lord Knight instead).
