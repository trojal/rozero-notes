## Steal skill improvement

There are no random options for equipment currently stolen by Thieves using Steal. In the future, this will be corrected.

## New areas

At the same time as the second job class update, three new dungeons will be opened, and some of the dungeons are made up of the "Fever" area.

### Turtle Island Dungeon

Turtle Island Dungeon, consisting of one field and three dungeon levels (a total of four maps), is a dungeon specializing in insect and animal monsters. You can take a boat from Alberta.

### Clock Tower Dungeon

The Clock Tower in the center of Aldebaran, which is composed of various levels, is a dungeon specaliazing in formless monsters.

### Glast Heim Dungeon

The Glast Heim Dungeon, located to the west of Geffen, is a complex dungeon consisting of various dungeons. There are various kinds of monsters such as demon, undead, and insect types.

## Direction of New Fever Areas
 
In the old Fever areas, there were two benefits: acquiring equipment and acquiring experience. The experience points were there to help level up to second job. For the newly added Fever areas after the second job update, the focus will be on equipment acquisition rather than experience.

## 신규 MD 3종 및 MD 장비 업데이트

99레벨 확장에 따라 70레벨, 80레벨, 99레벨대의 총 3종의 새로운 메모리얼 던전이 업데이트될 예정입니다. 신규 던전 업데이트에 따라 새로운 장비들도 업데이트되며, 이러한 장비들은 이전 단계의 장비와 함께 젤로스톤과 기타 재료를 통해 업그레이드하여 획득 가능할 예정입니다.

## Condition change in item distribution

During party play, the criteria for equitable distribution of items will change. In the past, the item would be distributed to a random party member in the 11 x 11 cell range of the player who picked up the item. Moving forward, this cell range will increase to 31 x 31. 

## Change the weight limit value of some manufacturing skills

Arrow Creation and Stone Picking skills will be usable up to 70% overweight instead of 50% overweight.
