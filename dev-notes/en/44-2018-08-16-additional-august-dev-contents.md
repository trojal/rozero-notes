# Additional August Development Contents

[ 2018.08.16 ]

Hi. Ragnarok users Ragnarok Zero team of RO1 studio. Today, we will introduce the contents that are under development.

## 1. New territory: Malangdo added

The new area Malangdo is added.

Malangdo is the name of a remote island with a strong ambition to earn big money.

You can acquire various rewards by acquiring the mysterion amulet "Sea God's Decision" (바다신의 결정) through various quests from the cats who have settled on the island..

There are also two underground dungeons in Malangdo, and most of the monsters are water property. On the second floor are monsters level 100+. New equipment also drops from the underground dungeon monsters.

< Various items can be obtained! >
 
Malangdo is currently undergoing internal testing, and the update scheduled has been postponed from the August update.

## 2. Some skill balance adjustments

Some balances will be made for secondary occupation skills before the transcendent class update. The ongoing adjustments are as follows.

### 1) Knight

#### Brandish Spear

The way Brandish Spear damage has been applied to different ranges has been improved. Now it gives the same percentage damage to all targets within range, and damage is increased. Additionally, the damage is divided into three pieces, to make it easier to see. Additionally, a 2 second skill cooldown is added and the SP required has increased.

![brandish spear gif](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/08/16/045153_KKaeA3MC.gif)

< Brandish Spear performance is improved >
 
Pierce is most effective against Large targets. Especially since it is a skill that can be used several times with a small amount of SP, Pierce will keep its current mechanics. We have improved Brandish Spear to give powerful damage regardless of the size of the target.

### 2) Wizard

#### Lord of Vermilion

Lord of Vermilion's ability to divide 4 damage 10 times will now be changed to divide 20 damages one time, and the damage will be increased.

![lord of vermilion gif](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/08/16/045231_g4qHLOhk.gif)

< Lord of Vermilion now changes to give a single powerful wind damage >
 
스톰 가스트의 동빙된 대상을 지속적으로 해제시켜 스톰 가스트의 데미지를 지속적으로 받을 수 있도록 사용되는 것과 다수의 타격으로 대상의 이동을 방해하는 용도로 사용되어졌습니다. 이번 개선을 통해 Lord of Vermilion을 스톰 가스트의 지속적인 동빙 상태를 계속 해제하는 용도가 아닌 동빙 상태의 대상에게 강력한 풍속성 마법 데미지를 줄 수 있도록 변경하였습니다. 또한 4회의 암흑 상태이상 부여 기회가 1회로 줄어들었기 때문에 암흑 상태이상 확률을 상향 조정하였습니다.

### 3) Priest

#### Magnus Exorcimus

Skill now deals higher damage to Demon, Undead, and Shadow/Dark targets. Skill cooldown is increased from 4 to 6 seconds.

![priest me skill gif](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/08/16/045512_Pfwwpq5X.gif)

<Magnus Exorcimus is now enhanced >

### 4) Assassin

#### Sonic Blow

Damage is increased, and attack animation happens only once instead of 8 times. Also, if the target's HP is less than 50%, damage will be increased by 50%. A skill cooldown of 1 second is added.

![assassin sonic blow gif](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/08/16/045601_LCOcpCu1.gif)

< Improved feeling of Sonic Blow >
 
Sonic Blow is the only Katar single attack skill that Assassin can use. However, it was not enough to use it as a flagship skill due to low damage with forced attack motion output. In order to further reinforce the assassin's concept, we have removed the attack motion output of Sonic Blow, increased the damage and adjusted it to give higher damage to targets with less than 50% HP.

### 5) Alchemist

#### Bomb / Demonstration

Damage formula is changed, and it is changed to increase the damage depending on the level of Potion Research.

#### Acid Terror

The damage formula is changed, and it is changed to increase the damage depending on the skill level of Potion Research. Damage is changed to display five times.

![alchemist bomb gif](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/08/16/045658_lDQycNTe.gif)

< Item is consumed, but Alchemist will do more damage >
 
Alchemists have been adjusted to increase the effectiveness of combat using potions. In the case of Acid Terror, the formula has been adjusted to take into account ATK now (특히 애시드 테러의 경우 이제 ATK 에 대한 확실한 데미지를 낼 수 있도록 공식이 조정되었습니다).

### 6) Sage

#### Endow Tsunami / Endow Tornado / Endow Quake / Endow Blaze

Each consumed item is changed to: Indigo Point (인디고 포인트) / Yellow Wish Point (옐로우위시 포인트) / Lime Green Point (라임그린 포인트) / Scarlet Point (스칼렛 포인트). The probability of failure has been removed, and the duration changes according to skill level. Also, depending on the skill level, each attribute has an effect that increases the magic damage of the property.

![sage skill gif](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/08/16/045741_zTDHgMhh.gif)

< The feeling of the endow skill is improved! >
 
We have changed the item requirements for the endow skills so they are an item purchasable via NPC. That way Sages can more actively support party members. In addition, we've added that the endow will increase magic damage of that same type (Endow Blaze increases fire magic damage, for example).

### 7) Monk

#### Raging Trifecta Blow

The activation chance is fixed at 30% regardless of skill level.

#### Raging Thrust

In addition to existing damage formula, damage is adjusted to increase with STR.

![monk raging thrust gif](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/08/16/045837_rAijX7Sb.gif)　　　　

< Raging Thrust damage increased. >

#### Root

When a target is caught, the duration of the effect changes to 10 seconds, regardless of skill level. Also, it can be used for boss-type monsters. If you catch boss-type monsters, the effect duration is 1/5th. In addition, 3 second skill cooldown is added.

#### Throw Spirit Sphere

Regardless of skill level, it will only be one spell. Also damage is increased, and the damage is changed to divide 5 times. In addition, targets taken by Root will receive 50% increased damage, and a skill cooldown of 1 second will be added.

![monk throw spirit sphere gif](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/08/16/045931_KCXuqADq.gif)

< Changed for ease of use >

#### Occult Impaction

Skill damage ratio is slightly increased and Root targets are adjusted to increase the skill damage rate by 50%.

![occult impaction gif](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/08/16/050004_xojk9gLk.gif)

< When using with Root, it gives higher damage. >
 
#### Asura Strike

When used in conjunction with Raging Thrust, one or more spheres will change to be activated. When used in combo, only some effects will be output, and the effect will not be activated.

(Raging Thrust에 이어 연계로 사용할 때 기 구체가 1개 이상이면 발동되도록 변경됩니다. 연계로 사용할 경우 간혹 일부 이펙트만 출력되고 효과는 발동하지 않던 현상이 수정됩니다.)

![monk asura strike gif](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/08/16/050034_slbjv2tJ.gif)

< If there is even one sphere, then asura strike can be used in a combo! >
 
Raging Thrust has been adjusted to enhance the ease of use with Asura Strike as well as damage. Though Monk does not have a range skill, Monk has been improved to give higher damage to a single target.

That's what is currently under development!
