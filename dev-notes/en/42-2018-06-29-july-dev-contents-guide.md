# July development contents guide

[ 2018.06.29 ]

Hi. Ragnarok Zero users. Ragnarok Zero team of RO1 studio. Today, we will show you what we're adding in July.

## 1. Change environment when battle is disabled

When you die, you get a gray screen and can't see anything - i.e., no chat, no monsters, no players, no announcements, etc.

< When a player is unable to battle (i.e. dead), nearby monsters will be hidden from view. >

< Even if the battle is disabled, you can see other nearby characters. >

## 2. Play Dead mechanics change

"Play Dead" skill is not considered combat status, so you will still be able to see nearby monsters. However, Play Dead mechanics have changed to the below:

1) Skill duration of 30 seconds is added.
2) Play Dead state is maintained until 30 seconds have elapsed (you can't release Play Dead until the duration is over).
3) 60 second cast time added.

## 3. Change enchantment method

After the secondary job enchantment that was added with the second job update, we received a request to add a new directional enchant.

A new secondary job essence enchant has been added through this update, and now there are 64 (?!) kinds of job enchants that have been added.

As a result, a middle enchantment slot has been added so that you can get an essence enchant in a slightly cheaper way.

Players complained about the cost of enchanting, so now you can use a Gel Star or Zeny. The price is still maybe too high, so we need to figure out a different system.

Here's how it's changed.

1) First Job Essence Enchant NPC
  * Enchantment NPC with a probability of adding first job essence enchant (1st - 2nd Lvl Essence) to +9 or higher armor (cost per enchant: 100,000 zeny)
  * ※ Expedition Armor (Grade II) 4th slot / Dispatching Armor (Grade III) 3rd slot / Conquering Armor (Grade IV) 2nd slot
  * ※ Enchanting method is the same as the existing enchantment method

2) Second Job Essence Enchant NPC
  * Enchantment NPC with a probability of adding secondary job essence enchant (1st - 2nd Lvl Essence) to +9 or higher armor (cost per enchant: 100,000 zeny)
  * ※ Expedition Armor (Grade II) 4th slot / Dispatching Armor (Grade III) 3rd slot / Conquering Armor 2nd slot
  * ※ Enchanting method is the same as the existing enchantment method

3) Ninja Essence Enchant NPC
  * Enchantment NPC with a probability of adding secondary job essence enchant (1st - 2nd Lvl Essence) to +9 or higher armor (cost per enchant: 100,000 zeny)
  * ※ Expedition Armor (Grade II) 4th slot / Dispatching Armor (Grade III) 3rd slot / Conquering Armor 2nd slot
  * ※ Enchanting method is the same as the existing enchantment method

Additionally enchant NPCs will be divided so that you will have higher chance of getting the enchant you want. If 1 NPC has too many enchantment options the chance will be lower but divide it to few more NPC and give each NPC specific class enchantment will let you have higher chance of getting the enchant you want.

As soon as this change is made, the service of the employees of the Intermediate Enchantment Association will be terminated.

That's it so far for July. If you have any questions or comments about the game, please contact us.

Thank you.
