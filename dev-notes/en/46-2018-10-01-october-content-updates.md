Hi. Ragnarok users Ragnarok Zero team of RO1 studio. Today, we would like to introduce about the contents to be updated in October.

## 1. Hugel update
 
The second regional power city of the Republic of Schwalzwald, Hugel, will be added.

Also, "Abyss Lake" and "Odin Shrine" dungeons will be opened. You can upgrade your existing helmets to new helmets by purchasing "Hugel Gift Certificates" (“휘겔 상품권") with "Hugel Tokens" ("휘겔 토큰") available through various daily quests.
