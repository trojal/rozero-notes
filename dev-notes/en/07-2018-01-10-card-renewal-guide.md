# Card Renewal Guide

[ 2018.01.10 ]

Hi Ragnarok users. Ragnarok Online of RO1 Studio: Zero team. Today we will talk about the renewal of past cards which is currently being planned. We are preparing for an update on January 31, 2018. The details are as follows.

## Boss card renewal
 
There are a lot of users who think that some boss cards are not so good compared to the difficulty. I am going to change some MVP card options from the past.

## Same card options, but change the area

The Doppleganger card was socketed in a weapon, which meant players had to give up a card that could have increased their damage. Therefore, Doppleganger card will not be socketable in an accessory.

## Change of option itself
 
The Osiris card was considered ineffective for being a boss card. Therefore, I would like to add an option for that card.

In addition, many boss cards like Drake, Amon Ra, Stormy Knight, etc are going to be renewed sequentially.

## Elimination of absorption options
 
For this card, the HP / SP absorption option has been removed.

위 카드는 마법 계열의 직업을 완전히 무력화시키거나 문제가 되었던 카드입니다.

황금 도둑벌레카드와 마야 카드는 변경이 완료되어 제로 서버에 정상 적용된 상태입니다.

Thank you for your interest.
