< View of the castle >

“In Alberta, on the southern end of the Midgardian continent, people with different outfits have appeared. They speak of a place where they live, and want people to go and visit. The people who went there speak of an exotic country, different from that of the Midgard continent. The adventurers' interest in the new continent grew deeper.”

If you pay 10,000 zeny to the "Ambassador of Publicity" (“용지성 홍보대사”) (alberta 246 40), you can go to Louyang.

Please note that all quests in the castle work for characters with a base level of 70 or higher.
