## 2. 용지성 개선

### 1) 지룡무기 개선

지룡 무기는 협소한 범위이지만 속성과 종족 두 가지 조건을 동시에 만족하면 시너지를 낼 수 있도록 제작하였습니다. 앞으로도 로컬라이징에서 교환하여 얻는 장비는 지룡 무기 같이 특정 속성과 종족에게 데미지 increase 옵션을 가질 것입니다. 일례로 아마쯔 지역에서는 악마형 몬스터 및 화속성 적에게 주는 데미지가 increase하는 장비가 추가될 예정입니다.

다만, 성능을 보다 자유롭게 상승시킬 수 있도록 인챈트 부여 기능을 삭제하고 랜덤 옵션을 부여하거나 부여된 랜덤 옵션을 갱신하는 아이템이 추가되며, 해당 아이템은 지룡석으로 교환할 수 있게 됩니다.

※ 단, 이미 인챈트되어있는 장비는 랜덤 옵션 부여가 불가능하므로 4월간 용지성 안에 인챈트를 무료로 제거해주는 NPC가 제공될 예정입니다.

![katar magic gif](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/04/03/021417_Nfnwabbq.gif)

![html table](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/04/03/021442_4vz6f8ZM.png)

<랜덤 옵션은 최소 1개에서 최대 2개까지 부여됩니다>

![special weapons](http://imgc.gnjoy.com/ufile/common/2018/04/03/021507_z6NE6a6I.png)
