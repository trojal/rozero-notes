# January 2018 More Update Information

[ 2018.01.10 ]

Hi. Ragnarok users. Ragnarok Zero team of RO1 studio. Today we're going to start a new year and give you a brief introduction to the big update scheduled for January 31.

## Add 2nd class jobs

The secondary job class is updated.

Change to second class by completing a quest. To do the quest you must be at least base level 50 and job level 50.

< The updated second classes >

However, in the 2nd job class announcement on Dec 28, 2017, we mentioned Bard & Dancer. On January 31, you will not be able to change to those classes, as their skills are still being redevoloped.

We apologize for this postponement.

## Add new territories

### Glast Heim Dungeon

Glast Heim will be added, and some areas will appear as Fever dungeons. In that dungeon, you can get equipment items for second classes, but you will need close collaboration with other players in a party.

## Memorial Dungeon Armor Upgrade

Using Jello Stone (created from Poring Village Jello Fragments) and Shimmering Crystal (from Memory of Orc Memorial Dungeon), you can upgrade the Expedition armor via NPC.

※ 방어구 업그레이드 시 '토벌단 방어구'의 강화도 및 인첸트는 초기화되어 '원정대 방어구에' 적용되지 않습니다. (1/12 추가)

You can choose to upgrade to two types of armor, and the upgrade will depend on the Jello Stone used.

Expedition Armor (8 types) can be upgraded to Armored Armor (16 types)

‘파병대 방어구(16종)’은 90레벨 장비인 ‘정복자 방어구’로 업그레이드 가능하며, 이 경우 ‘붉은 마력의 결정체’와 ‘젤로스톤’이 필요합니다.

또한 방어구 중 갑옷 장비에는 ‘직업의 정수’를 인챈트 할 수 있으며, 신규 ‘직업의 정수(30종)’가 추가됩니다.
