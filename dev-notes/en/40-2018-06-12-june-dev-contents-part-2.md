Hi. Ragnarok Zero Users, it is Ragnarok Zero team of RO1 studio. Today, we will introduce you to the contents of the development in June following the last contents.

## 1. Schwartzwald's Capital, Juno

Now Schwartzwald's Republic appears.

"Juno", the capital city of wisdom, is the first to be added in the Republic of Schwartzwald. Now a new adventure takes place in the Schwartzwald Republic, leaving the Kingdom of Rune Midgard.

< The capital of the Schwartzwald Republic will soon be released! >

## 2. New Dungeon : Magma

Magma dungeon with hot lava flows will be added.

The Magma Dungeon is a battle against a variety of fast-paced monsters in narrow terrain rising over the lava. It consists of two general dungeons and one Fever region. The third floor, which is the Fever area, consists of lava terraces that are hardening, and there are powerful monsters of various attributes as well as speed.

< Magma 3rd floor consists of hardened lava topography! >

Magma's 3rd floor monsters drop Mithril Ore, so Mithril Ore gains are relatively higher than other Fever areas. If you're looking for Mithril Ore, head to Magma 3rd floor.

## 3. New Dungeon : Juperos

The dungeon of the ruined, forgotten civilization Juperos will be added.

In the runis of the ancient, forgotten civilization Juperos, various mechanical (formless) monsters appear. In Juperos, you can acquire various equipment and accessories.

## 4. [Safety Wall] and [Pneuma]

There are cases that ranged attack or ranged skill attack damage blocked by safety wall rather than pneuma.

Current skills were inspected and the results in PvP are safety wall and pneuma works normally.

But in PvE we found the effects works differently

As following safety wall and pneuma's error in blocking certain attack will be counted as bug.

We fixed it on last patch but if there are more error in the future it will be patched as well.

The effects of [Safety Wall] and [Pneuma] are shown below.

### 1) [Safety Wall]

PVP : Ignores melee attacks (including skills).

PVE : Ignores melee attacks (including skills).

### 2) [Pneuma]

PVP : Ignores ranged attacks (including skills).

PVE : Ignores ranged attacks (including skills).

We've introduced you to what we are developing so far. It is still under development, and contents may change at a later date. For more details, please refer to the update notice.
