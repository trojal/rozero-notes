# June Development Contents Part 2

[ 2018.06.12 ]

Hi. Ragnarok Zero Users, it is Ragnarok Zero team of RO1 studio. Today, we will introduce you to the contents of the development in June following the last contents.

## 1. Schwartzwald's Capital, Juno

Now Schwartzwald's Republic appears.

"Juno", the capital city of wisdom, is the first to be added in the Republic of Schwartzwald. Now a new adventure takes place in the Schwartzwald Republic, leaving the Kingdom of Rune Midgard.

< The capital of the Schwartzwald Republic will soon be released! >

## 2. New Dungeon : Magma

Magma dungeon with hot lava flows will be added.

The Magma Dungeon is a battle against a variety of fast-paced monsters in narrow terrain rising over the lava. It consists of two general dungeons and one Fever region. The third floor, which is the Fever area, consists of lava terraces that are hardening, and there are powerful monsters of various attributes as well as speed.

< Magma 3rd floor consists of hardened lava topography! >

Magma's 3rd floor monsters drop Mithril Ore, so Mithril Ore gains are relatively higher than other Fever areas. If you're looking for Mithril Ore, head to Magma 3rd floor.

## 3. New Dungeon : Juperos

The dungeon of the ruined, forgotten civilization Juperos will be added.

In the runis of the ancient, forgotten civilization Juperos, various mechanical (formless) monsters appear. In Juperos, you can acquire various equipment and accessories.

## 4. [Safety Wall] and [Pneuma]

There are inconsistencies with how [Pneuma] and [Safety Wall] blocked attacks and skills in PVE & PVP. This is a bug and will be fixed to be more consistent.

(Note: The above is a summary of the Korean, as Google Translate struggled with the Korean a bit. Korean included below.)

몬스터의 원거리 물리 공격 또는 원거리 물리 스킬이 [Pneuma]가 아닌 [Safety Wall]에 차단되는 현상이 있었습니다. 해당 내용을 면밀히 검토한 결과 PVP에서는 [Safety Wall]과 [Pneuma]가 각 공격의 판정에 맞게 적용되지만, PVE에서는 해당 사항이 케이스 별로 다르게 적용되고 있는 점이 발견되었습니다.

이에 대해 [Safety Wall]과 [Pneuma]의 정의를 확정하고 해당 정의에 벗어나는 경우는 버그로 간주하여 지난 정기점검 시 수정 적용하였으며, 이후 추가로 발견되는 내용에 대해서도 수정할 계획입니다.

The effects of [Safety Wall] and [Pneuma] are shown below.

### 1) [Safety Wall]

PVP : Ignores melee attacks (including skills).

PVE : Ignores melee attacks (including skills).

### 2) [Pneuma]

PVP : Ignores ranged attacks (including skills).

PVE : Ignores ranged attacks (including skills).

We've introduced you to what we are developing so far. It is still under development, and contents may change at a later date. For more details, please refer to the update notice.
