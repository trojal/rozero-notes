## Purchase booth deal (구매 노점 거래)

Purchase stalls allow other players to input items they want to buy, with a specific amount of Zeny they'd like to pay. Players must have one of the items they are seeking to purchase already in their inventory.

Then, other players can sell these items to the player via their purchase stall.

Merchant class characters can learn the skill to set up a purchase booth via the "Buyer's Helper" (구매부 허선비) NPC in the Alberta Merchant Guild. This is also where they can buy permits to set up a purchase stall.

Other classes can buy permits from the "Black Trader" (검은 상인) NPC in the Morroc Underground Liquor Store.

Only certain items can be purchased through a purchase stall. Those are: "Etc. Items" and "Non-Brewed Consumable Items".

## Individual transactions (개인 거래)

Direct item or zeny exchange between users is possible via a transaction.

Right-click on the character you want to trade with and select "Request transaction with 000" (000 님과의 거래요청) from the displayed menu.

When the other party accepts the transaction request, an exchange window is displayed. After dragging the item to be traded or Zeny, when both sides press the "OK" button, "Exchange" button becomes active.

The items registered in the exchange window can be checked by clicking the right mouse button. If you click the activated "Exchange" button, the personal transaction is completed.
