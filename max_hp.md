# Max HP

## Calculation

This is an update on the work done by the [irowiki](https://irowiki.org/wiki/Max_HP) team. Requires further testing before can confirm 100%.

Currently have only tested on a Novice up to base level 14. For Novices, their base HP increases by 3 when going to an even number (2, 4, 6, 8...) and by 4 when going to an odd number (3, 5, 7, 9...).

Further testing is needed to see if this pattern continues with other classes.
