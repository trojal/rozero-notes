# Memorial Dungeon Equipment Enchanting

Enchanting Memorial Dungeon Equipment is similar to the Mora Enchant System. You're able to enchant different grades of equipment with different stats-based and class-based enchants.

## General Info

* It costs 100,000 Zeny or 1 Gel Star to enchant a piece of Memorial Dungeon Equipment.
* If you use Zeny, there is a 30% chance your equipment will be destroyed. If you use a Gel Star, this chance of destruction is removed.
* There are two types of enchants: stats-based and class-based.
* If the piece of equipment is +9 or greater, there are more enchant possibilities and you can get a random class essence enchant.

## Enchanting NPCs

* To enchant Subjugation (Grade IV) Equipment, head to `prt_fild05 251 193`, near the entrance to Prontera Culvert.
* To enchant Expedition (Grade III), Dispatching (II), and Conquering (I) Equipment, see the NPCs inside the building at `prontera 50 227`.

## Enchanting Possibilities

### Stats-Based Enchants

For Expedition (Grade III), Dispatching (II), and Conquering (I) Equipment, the possible stats-based enchants will be chosen randomly from Group 1, described below.

For Subjugation (Grade IV) Equipment that is +9 or higher, the possible stats-based enchants will be chosen randomly from *both Group 1 & Group 2*.

### Class-based Essence Enchants

Besides stats-based enchants, you can also enchant equipment with class-based essences, that give class-specific bonuses.

To enchant a piece of equipment with a class-based essence enchant, it must be +9 or greater. The enchant is chosen randomly, but if you use an enchanter NPC specific to your class, you are more likely to get one of your class' essence.

Subjugation (Grade IV) Equipment can get one of the following class-based enchants:

  </tr>
