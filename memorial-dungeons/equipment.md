# Memorial Dungeon Equipment

Memorial Dungeon equipment is broken up into four grades (Grade IV being the lowest, Grade I being the highest). The grades are as follows:

* Subjugation Equipment (Grade IV)
* Expedition Equipment (Grade III)
* Dispatching Equipment (Grade II)
* Conquering Equipment (Grade I)

All Memorial Dungeon equipment can be worn by all classes, and each piece of equipment has one card slot.

Obtaining Memorial Dungeon equipment of a higher grade is done through crafting. With crafting, you take a piece of equipment of a previous grade + various materials, and you get the next grade equivalent of that piece. See the `equipment-crafting.md` file for more information.

### Subjugation Equipment (Grade IV)
