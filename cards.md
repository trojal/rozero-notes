# Cards (카드)

Upgrade your character through card combinations! Develop various combinations to create your own items.

## What is the card system? (카드시스템이란?)

In Ragnarok Zero, most monsters drop, at a low chance, cards named after them (ex: a Poring drops a Poring Card). Cards are given different options. When you put a Card in a weapon or armor socket, the card's capabilities are manifested.

| Color (색상) | Monster property (몬스터 속성) |
|---|---|
| Brown (갈색) | Salt property (염속성) |
| Black (검정색) | Cancer property (암속성) |
| Hyacinth (보라색) | Dock property (독속성) |
| Light Green (연두색) | Wind property (풍속성) |
| Amethyst (자주색) | Undead (언데드) |
| Green (초록색) | Persistence property (지속성) |
| Blue (파란색) | Number property (수속성) |

If you click the "View" (보기) button in the Card details, you will see a cute illustration of the monster. You can also check the monster's property information.

## Combining cards (카드 조합하기)

To put cards into equipment, you need equipment with sockets. Put the equipment on. Double-click the card to display a list of equipment that the card can be socketed into.

Note that all possible equipment you can socket into with that card is displayed. It may be very difficult to remove the card once socketed.

After socketing the card, you can see the socketed card in the equipment information window.

Because each card has its own prefix and suffix, it will change the name of the piece of equipment when it is socketed into it.

Also, when multiple cards of the same card are socketed in one piece of equipment, the unique name is given an additional name.
